# ReadMe
The File we are running contains two functions, **factorial** and **check_leap_year**.

In this discussion section you will need to design test cases to test whether the code in these functions is correct.

The following section provides the syntax for invoking the methods, and English descriptions of what each function is supposed to do.

You should plan and then write tests in your groups for these methods. Then we'll test our code and see if it works!

## factorial(num)
|Parameter| Function Description|
|----|----|
|**num**| Accepts num (int), computes its factorial and returns the value |

For example:
```factorial(0)``` should return ```1```
```factorial(1)``` should return ```1```
```factorial(-5)``` should return ```None```
```factorial(5)``` should return ```120```

## check_leap_year(year)
|Parameter| Function Description|
|----|----|
|**year**| Accepts a year (int) and checks if it is a leap year. Returns True if it is, and False if not|

For example:
```check_leap_year(1900)``` should return ```False```
```check_leap_year(1912)``` should return ```True```
```check_leap_year(2000)``` should return ```True```


## Things to keep in mind as you go -
1. Initialize a local git repository (git init)

2. Check status continuously to keep track of changes in your code and directory (git status)

3. After writing each test, add your modified code to the local repo (git add <filename>)

4. Commit the changes in code to the local repo (git commit <filename> )

5. After each commit, check the history of your commits (git log)

6. Once all test cases are done, push your code to github. You may need to create a repository on github for that. (git
